# Super TicTacToe in C

## What this program is about
- This program is another mini project using C. This program is a Super TicTacToe game that uses a 2D Array to store the states of the elements of the board. It has an AI that serves as the enemy of the player (although the 'AI' is just getting random numbers from rand()).


## Problems encountered
- Lost motivation while working on this project, which led to this project not well-documented. I forgot most of the problems that I have encountered while working on this project. Fortunately, most of the problems that I have encountered were similar to the problems that I have encountered during the [Simple_Cafeteria](https://github.com/xbryan25/Simple_Cafeteria) project.
- The hard part while making this project was making the program fulfill the rules of the Super TicTacToe game. It involves a lot of function calls, which made me confused about the logic. 
- I took a month-long break while making this project, which made me forget some functionalities of the program.
- Will polish once my passion for this project goes back :(( .
